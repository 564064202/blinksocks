# Suites

Here I prepared a set of suites file used by [auto-conf] preset, feel free to add/delete/modify them to meet your own needs.

|      NAME       |           REMARKS            |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------- |
| [suites-0.json] | enhanced ss and original ssr protocols |

[auto-conf]: ../docs/presets#auto-conf
[suites-0.json]: ./suites-0.json

## Update Caveats

Please pay attention to the updates of suites you use. Any changes to the json file requires **synchronization** and **restart** on both client and server.
